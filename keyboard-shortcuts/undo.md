# Undo Keyboard Shortcut

| Action | Keys | Keystroke | Application | PC Equivalent |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Undo last action | `⌘+z` | Command + Z | universal | `Ctrl+z` |

## What it does

Reverses the most recent action you performed, restoring the previous state. Can typically be used multiple times to step backwards through your action history.

Think of it like a universal "back" button - it works in almost all apps and environments.

## When to use it

- After making a typo or unwanted text change
- When you accidentally delete something important
- After applying the wrong formatting or style
- When experimenting with changes you might want to reverse
- After moving or modifying something incorrectly

## Example

Scenario: Writing an email and accidentally deleting a paragraph

1. You're editing an email and select a paragraph
2. You accidentally hit Delete instead of Copy
3. Press `⌘+z` (Mac) or `Ctrl+z` (PC)
4. The deleted paragraph immediately reappears
5. Continue working without losing your content
